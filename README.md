# Masked-Autoencoders_Vision
Overview and discussion of Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners (He et al. 2021) 

## Background

## Research Question

## Approach 
+ mask random patches of the
input image and reconstruct the missing pixels
+ How?
  + Assymetric encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder operates on the patches of the visible image (below we see the patches with the flamingo visible are going into the encoder)
  +
